## 🙋‍♂️ Some stuff about me

Working full-time **full stack engineer** currently working mainly with Python and JavaScript on web apps running on microservices on the cloud.

Started scripting on lua for games when I was a kid without even know what that was.
After that discovered that I like it very much and was good at it so did some courses and here I am 🤓.

Love creating and assembling things together to solve real world problems.

Over and out. 🖖
